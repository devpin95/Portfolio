<p>Hello! My name is Devin and I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Scientist. I currently attend the University of Colorado Denver in the College of Engineering and Applied Science after receiving my Associates of Applied Science from Front Range Community College in 2016. I am extremely interesting and excited to write software that solves hard problems or does something cool and fun.</p>

<p>I discovered my love for programming in high school while attending a Web and Game Applications class at Boulder Career Technical Education Center where we learned to make websites and Flash games. There, I found making computers do what I want them to do is the most challenging and rewarding skill I had developed and decided to persue the talent in to my college and professional career.</p>

<p>During my time as a student, I have learned to think as a Computer Scientist when applying my skills to develop technology in a fast-evolving field. This means learning many programming languages and the intricacies between them so that they may be used appropriately and efficiently. I have programmed/developed in C/C++, Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, CSS3, and JQuery with hope to expand the list as my career continues.</p>
